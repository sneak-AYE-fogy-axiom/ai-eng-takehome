# University Academic Data Rules (university Database)

The academic affairs division maintains these data standards:

## Student Metrics

- "Active" students are those with at least one course registration in the current or previous term.
- Students with all 'F' grades in a term should be flagged for academic probation analysis.
- Transfer students (those without a first-year record) should be analyzed separately for retention metrics.

## Course Management

- Courses with enrollment under 5 students should be flagged as potential cancellation candidates.
- Cross-listed courses (same course, multiple departments) should be counted ONCE for course offering totals.
- Lab sections should be linked to their parent lecture course for credit hour calculations.

## Grade Calculations

- GPA calculations use the standard 4.0 scale: A=4.0, B=3.0, C=2.0, D=1.0, F=0.0.
- Plus/minus grades adjust by ±0.3 (e.g., A- = 3.7, B+ = 3.3).
- Incomplete grades ('I') should be excluded from current GPA but tracked separately.
- Pass/Fail courses do NOT count toward GPA calculations.

## Professor Evaluation

- Course evaluation scores below 3.0 (on 5.0 scale) should be flagged for review.
- New professors (first 2 years) should be evaluated against a separate benchmark, not the department average.
- Never report individual professor evaluations with fewer than 10 respondents.

## Research Assistant Rules

- RAs (research assistants) are counted as students for enrollment metrics but should be flagged.
- RA funding levels are sensitive - aggregate by department, never by individual.
- Hours worked by RAs should be capped at 20/week for compliance with student employment rules.

## Registration Analysis

- Waitlist-to-enrollment conversion rate is a key metric for course demand analysis.
- Dropped courses (within add/drop period) should not count against student course load statistics.
- Repeat course attempts should be flagged - students taking a course more than twice require intervention.
