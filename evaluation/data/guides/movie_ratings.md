# Movie Database Analytics Rules (IMDB / MovieLens)

The entertainment analytics division follows these conventions:

## Rating Aggregation

- User ratings below 3.0 are considered "negative" for sentiment classification.
- Ratings of exactly 5.0 (max score) should be scrutinized - if a user gives more than 50% 5-star ratings, apply a 0.9x adjustment factor.
- Movies with fewer than 10 ratings should be excluded from "recommended" lists due to insufficient signal.

## Movie Classification

- Movies released before 1970 are "classic cinema" and should be analyzed separately in trend reports.
- TV movies and direct-to-video releases should be flagged and optionally excluded from theatrical release metrics.
- Documentary and short films are NOT feature films - always segment these separately.

## Actor/Director Analysis

- Only count actors with at least 3 credited roles in the database for "career analysis."
- Directors with only 1 film credit should be classified as "one-time directors" and excluded from directorial style analysis.
- Actor-director collaborations are defined as 2+ films together - single collaborations are not meaningful.

## User Behavior

- Users who have rated more than 1000 movies are "super users" - their preferences may not represent the general population.
- Users who rated fewer than 10 movies should be excluded from recommendation algorithm training.
- The time between a movie's release and a user's rating is relevant - ratings within 30 days are "early adopter" ratings.

## Genre Handling

- Movies can have multiple genres - for genre analysis, count each movie once per genre (not just primary genre).
- The "Drama" genre is overrepresented - consider normalizing by genre frequency in comparative analysis.
- Horror and Comedy should never be combined into "Horror-Comedy" for aggregation - keep them distinct.
